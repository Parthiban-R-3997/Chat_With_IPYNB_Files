Venue Influence: Certain venues have historically favored specific teams or winning modes, highlighting the importance of venue-specific strategies.
Future Work:

Prediction Model Development: Utilize the insights gained to develop a predictive model for match outcomes.
Incorporating Additional Features: Include pitch type, weather conditions, and ground dimensions to enhance the analysis and prediction accuracy.
Real-Time Analysis: Develop a real-time analysis system to track live match data and provide dynamic insights.
